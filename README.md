# Gaurav Chopra
I am a Web developer, a problem solver with a passion for WordPress.

With over 2 years' experience in Web development, I've worked with 20+ SMEs across India and US to bring their ideas to life. I'm curious about the world around me and I love learning from my experiences. On a personal front I make music and play Table Tennis for fun. 

At present, I am working as a freelance Web Developer.
